Hi guys. In this repo, this repo contains tutorials about PyTorch. Let's take a look at some PyTorch features.

## What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open source machine learning and deep learning framework.

## What can PyTorch be used for?

PyTorch helps you manipulate and manipulate data and write machine learning algorithms using Python code.

## Who uses PyTorch?

Many of the worlds largest technology companies such as Meta, Tesla and Microsoft as well as AI research companies such as OpenAI use PyTorch to power research and bring machine learning to their products.

## Why use PyTorch?

PyTorch is the most used deep learning framework on Papers With Code, a website for tracking machine learning research papers and the code repositories attached with them.

## 

To install PyTorch, you can use the instruction [here](https://pytorch.org/). To import PyTorch, you can run as following codes.

```
import torch
torch.__version__
```
Additionally, to check if your GPU driver and CUDA is enabled and accessible by PyTorch, run the following commands to return whether or not the CUDA driver is enabled:

```
torch.cuda.is_available()
```
